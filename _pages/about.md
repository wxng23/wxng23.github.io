Hi there! Thanks for visiting.

My name is Andrew Wang and I am a Master's student at the University of Michigan. This website serves as a hub for random things that I do.

Professional life
------
I worked at Amazon last summer as a software development engineer intern. Worked on the cloud optimization team creating an API to speed up AWS Trusted Advisor's internal code review workflow. Learn more about what Trusted Advisor does [here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/technology/trusted-advisor/).

The summer before that, I worked at an enterprise storage startup called Infinidat as a software engineer intern. Mainly focused creating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation reference architecture for clients and developing an internal chatbot. Check out this [solution brief](https://www.infinidat.com/en/resource-pdfs/ai-workloads.pdf) that I helped create!

Everything else
------
I love soccer. Played ECNL before college, club soccer at Michigan, and semi-pro teams over the summer. Liverpool fan - played for their international academy when I was younger.
