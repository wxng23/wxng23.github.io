Hi there! Thanks for visiting.

My name is Andrew Wang and I am a Master's student at the University of Michigan. This website serves as a hub for random things that I do.

Professional life
------
I worked at Amazon last summer as a software development engineer intern. I spent the majority of my time working on an API to make AWS Trusted Advisor's internal code review workflow more efficient. 

Everything else
------
I love soccer. Played ECNL before college, club soccer at Michigan, and semi-pro teams over the summer. Liverpool fan - played for their international academy when I was younger.
