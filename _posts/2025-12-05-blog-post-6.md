Quick hits for Chicago Fire's last 10 games.

Attacking
-----
* Chicago likes to create chances by getting to the end line and providing cut back crosses or having early services. Rarely crosses from wide area. 12/16 (75%) crosses near goal line
* J. Bamba loves getting to the end line for cut back crosses. Make sure our midfielders continue tracking the late runs into the box. Athletic, will open body up then dart to line for a lefty cross on the ground. Very direct, be ready to run with him.
* A. Gutman varies his services more. Has more shape on his left than Bamba, will try to curl early crosses in behind back line.
* P. Zinckernagel takes people on more often. Finds himself in both wide and central areas. Looks to combine in the middle and beat players out wide. Break your feet down. A lot of their attack goes through him.

Defensive
------
* They will high press, the team has created a good chunk of good chances from winning in high up the field
* Their centerbacks are slow, could try to exploit this. Can draw out their outside backs with our wingers/wingback and re-distribute around the top of the box to look for a slotted through ball. Can get early crosses behind the back line on counters, need to put curve on the ball to get around the center back but hit our strikers.
