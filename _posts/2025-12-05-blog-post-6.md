Quick hits for Chicago Fire's last 10 games.

Attacking
-----
* Chicago likes to create chances by getting to the end line and providing cut back crosses or having early services. Rarely crosses from wide area. 12/16 (75%) crosses near goal line
* J. Bamba loves getting to the end line for cut back crosses. Make sure our midfielders continue tracking the late runs into the box. Athletic, will open body up then dart to line for a lefty cross on the ground. Very direct, be ready to run with him.
* A. Gutman varies his services more. Has more shape on his left than Bamba, will try to curl early crosses in behind back line.
* P. Zinckernagel takes people on more often. Finds himself in both wide and central areas. Looks to combine in the middle and beat players out wide. Break your feet down. A lot of their attack goes through him.

Defensive
------
* Keeper is prone to mistakes. Allow back line to have it and press as one when there is an opportunity.
* Right back isn't the most athletic. Slow him down and engage then quick change of pace should be able to beat him. Left side seems to have more success.
* Space is wide. Outside backs are tucked in. Wingers should maintain their width, usually not enough room to run off their back shoulder because of how compact they are.
