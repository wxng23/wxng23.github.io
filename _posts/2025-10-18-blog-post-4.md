Quick hits delivered to coaching staff regarding the Rutgers game on October 19, 2025. Data was accumulated through the current season's conference games to extract the most up-to-date information on the opposition teams and players.

Attacking
-----
* #17 (A. Baran) is their primary creator. Gets a lot of good crosses in and will take you on. 9 of 11 crosses with her lefty so more often than not expect her to try to end up on her left. Loves the right step over to go left.
* Chances in general come from wide, not much being created through the middle.

Defensive
------
* Their defense does not look as bad as their stats show. A lot of their goals against are just well crafted goals.
* A little slow to clear their lines so be on toes for rebounds. Be optimistic in front of goal.
