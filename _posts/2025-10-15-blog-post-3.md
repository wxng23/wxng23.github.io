Quick hits delivered to coaching staff regarding the Maryland game on October 16, 2025. Data was accumulated through the current season's conference games to extract the most up-to-date information on the opposition teams and players.

Attacking
-----
* #14 (K. Smith) is incredible at dribbling. Creates a lot of their chances, takes people on and will often beat them. Very fast shifts of the ball, we want to get support defensively so she isn't 1v1 against one of us.
* Favors attacking down left side.

Defensive
------
* Their back line isn't great, not as athletic as us. Our wingers should be beating their outside backs more often than not.
* Vulnerable to early crosses put behind the line but we will need to be making those runs into the box to give the option.
