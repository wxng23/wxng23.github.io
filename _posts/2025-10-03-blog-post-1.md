Quick hits delivered to coaching staff regarding the Iowa game on October 4, 2025. Data was accumulated through the current season's conference games to extract the most up-to-date information on the opposition teams and players.

Attacking
-----
* Heavily favors attacking down the right side.
* Strong in the air, make sure we are making our presence known -- even just jumping with them and making a nuisance is better than letting them get a free header.

Defensive
------
* Back post is vulnerable. Half of the big chances they had against them came from crosses to the back post.
