Quick hits delivered to coaching staff regarding the Illinois game on October 26, 2025. Data was accumulated through the current season's conference games to extract the most up-to-date information on the opposition teams and players.

Attacking
-----
* #7 (E. Yee) is efficient in beating defenders and getting to good positions to set up teammates. Goes to the end line often for cut back crosses.
* #22 (L. Howard) is good with the ball, threads passes in midfield. Has a good reverse pass so our defenders need to watch the counter-motion runs from their forwards while she is on the ball.
* #18 (S. Foley) has good services. Doesn't take people on often, tends to put early crosses in.

Defensive
------
* They will high press, the team has created a good chunk of good chances from winning in high up the field
* Their centerbacks are slow, could try to exploit this. Can draw out their outside backs with our wingers/wingback and re-distribute around the top of the box to look for a slotted through ball. Can get early crosses behind the back line on counters, need to put curve on the ball to get around the center back but hit our strikers.
