Quick hits delivered to coaching staff regarding the Michigan State game on October 9, 2025. Data was accumulated through the current season's conference games to extract the most up-to-date information on the opposition teams and players.

Attacking
-----
* Forms attacks centrally much more than other teams we've played.
* Lot of their big chances come from runs off the back shoulders of centerbacks. Have to be communicating when passing people off across the back line.

Defensive
------
* Their keeper is iffy on the ball but their defense is quality. Many of the big chances are just individual mistakes from the keeper.
